The webcamera is a Logitech C615 1080p HD Webcamera. It has a diagonal field of view (DFOV) of 74 degrees.

The RPi display will tentatively be 5" diagonally and will have a 480 x 800 pixel resolution screen leaving two halves of 480 x 400 pixels.


The second option is to use augmented realtiy. I will continue to use the Logitech C615 web camera and will tilt it ten degrees downward. Secondly, I will be using a 5" Raspberry Pi display. The screen will be angled so that it matches with the human field of view with 30 degrees below and 10 degrees above.
According to documentation, the 5" display is 10.80 by 6.48 centimeters on the sides. In the end, I will be using the screen 480 by 800 pixels out of the default 16:9 ratio of 854 to 480 which is a angle difference similar to what is the main human field of view.
